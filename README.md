- "At the end it's the question about money and passion. We have zero passion to support IE11 so it's all about money. We suggested to estimate a monetary value of supporting IE11. The idea behind is to find values for this simple formula: (cost of support) + (opportunity cost) - (profit) - (reputation cost)"

- [A typology of organisational cultures](https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/13/suppl_2/ii22) "The underlying idea is that leaders, by their preoccupations, shape a unit’s culture. Through their symbolic actions, as well as rewards and punishments, leaders communicate what they feel is important. These preferences then becomethe preoccupation of the organisation’s workforce, because rewards, punishments, and resources follow the leader’s preferences. Those who align with the preferences will be rewarded, and those who do not will be set aside. Most longtime organisation members instinctively know how to readthe signs of the times and those who do not soon get expensive lessons." and "The most critical issue for organisational safety is the flow of information"

It gives subordinates the confidence to apply their judgment in ambiguous and urgent situations because they know the mission’s purpose, key task, and desired end state. ... Using disciplined initiative, subordinates ... perform the necessary coordination and take appropriate action when existing orders no longer fit the situation."

> Product integrity has both an internal and an external dimension. Internal integrity refers to the consistency between a product’s function and its structure: the parts fit smoothly, the components match and work well together, the layout maximizes the available space.
> External integrity refers to the consistency between a product’s performance and customers’ expectations.

- [Shitlist Driven Development](https://sirupsen.com/shitlists/)
> Inspirational leaders: 
> - selectively show their weaknesses. By exposing some vulnerability, they reveal their approachability and humanity. 
> - rely heavily on intuition to gauge the appropriate timing and course of their actions. Their ability to collect and interpret soft data helps them know just when and how to act
> - manage employees with something we call tough empathy. Inspirational leaders empathize passionately—and realistically—with people, and they care intensely about the work employees do. 
> - reveal their differences. They capitalize on what’s unique about themselves. You may find yourself in a top position without these qualities, but few people will want to be led by you.

- [Software effort estimation is mostly fake research](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25825244)
> The issue with estimates are expectations. While nobody acknowledges it, you're not actually asked for an estimate, you're being asked for a quote.
> The difference is when you're asked for a quote, you're asked how much you will be charging, with the expectations that you'll be willing to eat into your own margins to give a lower quote. That's why it's a negotiation, where you negotiate how much extra effort, time and headcount you're willing to give, how much tech dept you're willing to take, etc., for the privilege of getting their business.
> If you see it for what it really is, you'll see that it works pretty well actually. The business gets more out of you for less to them. It was never about having an accurate timeline or helping with planning or prioritizing, and always about negotiating a better contract with the dev team.

> "The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under his or her supervision or influence"

> "You need to plan the way a fire department plans. It cannot anticipate where the next fire will be, so it has to shape an energetic and efficient team that is capable of responding to the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event"

> When a person is not doing his job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person either can’t do it or won’t do it; he is either not capable or not motivated.” This insight enables a manager to dramatically focus her efforts. All you can do to improve the output of an employee is motivate and train. There is nothing else

> It’s obvious that your decision-making depends finally on how well you comprehend the facts and issues facing your business. This is why information-gathering is so important in a manager’s life.

> While we move about, doing what we regard as our jobs, we are role models for people in our organization

> My day always ends when I’m tired and ready to go home, not when I’m done. I am never done. Like a housewife’s, a manager’s work is never done. There is always more to be done, more that should be done, always more than can be done.

> A manager must keep many balls in the air at the same time and shift his energy and attention to activities that will most increase the output of his organization. In other words, he should move to the point where his leverage will be the greatest.

> Reports are more a medium of self-discipline than a way to communicate information. writing the report is important; reading it often is not;
- [The Fifth Discipline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Discipline)
> Personal Mastery - This discipline focuses on individual growth and learning. It's about continually clarifying and deepening our personal vision, focusing energy, developing patience, and seeing reality objectively. It goes beyond skills and competencies to a lifelong commitment to learning.

> Mental Models - These are deeply ingrained assumptions and generalizations that influence how we understand and act in the world. The discipline involves turning the mirror inward, examining our internal pictures of the world, and making them open to scrutiny from others.

> Shared Vision - This is about building a genuine commitment to a common future we seek to create. Unlike many top-down vision statements, Senge emphasizes that true shared vision emerges from personal visions and must be co-created.

> Team Learning - This discipline starts with dialogue, where team members suspend assumptions and think together. It's about transforming conversational and collective thinking skills so groups can develop intelligence and capabilities greater than the sum of individual members' talents.

> Systems Thinking - This is the "fifth discipline" that integrates all others. It's about seeing interrelationships rather than linear cause-effect chains, and seeing processes of change rather than snapshots. This perspective helps understand how our actions create the problems we experience.
