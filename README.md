- [A typology of organisational cultures](https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/13/suppl_2/ii22) "The underlying idea is that leaders, by their preoccupations, shape a unit’s culture. Through their symbolic actions, as well as rewards and punishments, leaders communicate what they feel is important. These preferences then becomethe preoccupation of the organisation’s workforce, because rewards, punishments, and resources follow the leader’s preferences. Those who align with the preferences will be rewarded, and those who do not will be set aside. Most longtime organisation members instinctively know how to readthe signs of the times and those who do not soon get expensive lessons." and "The most critical issue for organisational safety is the flow of information"

It gives subordinates the confidence to apply their judgment in ambiguous and urgent situations because they know the mission’s purpose, key task, and desired end state. . . . Using disciplined initiative, subordinates . . . perform the necessary coordina-tion and take appropriate action when existing orders no longer fit the situation."

> "The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under his or her supervision or influence"

> "You need to plan the way a fire department plans. It cannot anticipate where the next fire will be, so it has to shape an energetic and efficient team that is capable of responding to the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event"

> When a person is not doing his job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person either can’t do it or won’t do it; he is either not capable or not motivated.” This insight enables a manager to dramatically focus her efforts. All you can do to improve the output of an employee is motivate and train. There is nothing else

> It’s obvious that your decision-making depends finally on how well you comprehend the facts and issues facing your business. This is why information-gathering is so important in a manager’s life.

> While we move about, doing what we regard as our jobs, we are role models for people in our organization
